Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

- Abelson & Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

## Thoughts

- Almost same logic but completely redesign functions
- My goal is never do unit testing for React components (keep it simple)
- To do that, `Key purpose are decouple components and business logic functions` then test logic functions only
- As functional programming lover, try to be free from side effects
