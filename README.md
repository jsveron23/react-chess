Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.

- Abelson & Sussman, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

## Thoughts

- Redesign functions
- Keep it simple
- Decouple components and business logic functions
- As functional programming lover, try to be free from side effects
- Want to write code for human understanding (naming is important)
